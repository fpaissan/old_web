Hey there, my name is Francesco Paissan, and I am 21 years old.
I am fascinated by the opportunity to model phenomena and broaden my understanding of various problems from different disciplines using different frameworks, from physics to deep learning.

I started with [robotics](http://archeorov.witlab.io), intending to make accessible to a broad audience something otherwise tricky to explore, namely underwater environments. During the development of the prototype of the underwater drone, I fell in love with physics and the idea of modelling the world using mathematics. Thus, I decided to pursue a bachelor degree in Physics at the University of Trento. At the same time, I had the opportunity to work in Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), where I started my journey as a research fellow under the supervision of [Dr. Elisabetta Farella](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=NOjpApQAAAAJ&hl=en). There, I am focusing on the development of efficient deep learning techniques for a variety of tasks. My primary interest is in multimedia analytics at the edge (e.g. audio-visual processing on microcontroller units).
Moreover, I am also developing new methodologies for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding and processing mainly based on neural nets. My involvement in this domain led me to collaborate on the [speechbrain toolkit](https://speechbrain.github.io) under the supervision of [Dr. Mirco Ravanelli](https://sites.google.com/site/mircoravanelli/). The goal of this collaboration is to add EEG processing pipelines to the speechbrain toolkit.

Despite working on various exciting problems in FBK and with speechbrain, I also wanted to develop a deeper understanding of physics and its research ecosystem. For this reason, I joined the [LEGEND200](https://legend-exp.org) collaboration under the supervision of [Prof. Giuseppe Salamanna](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiFt6ylw9HzAhWusaQKHVSCDWIQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsalaman.web.cern.ch%2F&usg=AOvVaw2PpWQukNKZC8ajwaake6vD) to develop and deploy novel solutions for machine learning applied to neutrino physics.
